    <h1>This is an accesible play-pause button. It is an alternative to HTML's native video controls.</h1>

    <h2>Why did you build that?</h2>
    <p>Multimedia elements such as images, audio tracks, and videos aren't as easily understood by screenreaders or navigated by the keyboard as text, and we need to give them a helping hand. All elements on a site need to be given proper textual alternatives so they can be understood by assistive technologies and their users.</p>
    
    <h2>Doesn't HTML already have a &ltvideo&gt tag that includes controls?</h2>
    <p>HTML5 video and audio instances even come with a set of inbuilt controls that allow you to control the media straight out of the box. </p>
